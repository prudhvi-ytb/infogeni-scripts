# InfoGeni Scripts

InfoGeni is my bilingual video series (Telugu + English) exploring the intersection of business, science and technology. This repository contains the raw scripts, outlines and research notes that power every episode.

## Why InfoGeni?

Modern AI and digital content often ignore regional languages and cultural context. As a founder building AI-driven tools and platforms, I wanted to share knowledge in an accessible way for Telugu and Indian audiences while also providing English transcripts for global reach.

By open-sourcing these scripts, I'm inviting others to learn from and contribute to the storytelling process. You'll find research on emerging technologies, interviews with entrepreneurs, and practical insights for makers and students.
